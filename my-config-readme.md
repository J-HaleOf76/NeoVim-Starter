## This is for my configuration files and how to use this on my laptop.
* I should clone and use this instead of the original repo.
* Push to here and pull from the OG repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/J-HaleOf76/NeoVim-Starter.git ~/.config/nvim
```

### This is the beginnings of my own config/system -- treat it as such --
- TODO -
- work on versioning
- Customize this and keep track of what's going on.
- neovim integrations
- keymaps
- floating windows
-
